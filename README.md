# CIFAR10 Dataset Image Classification using CNN

This is a project about designing and training a convolutional neural network(CNN) to classify image in CIFAR10 dataset.  

## User Instruction
### Installation
To be able to run or train the model on your device, you need to install dependencies stated in requirements.txt given. Here is a few things to take note:
- This project uses pytorch2.5.1 which only supports Python3.8~3.11. So, make sure you are running with compatible python version
- In the requirements.txt, torch==2.5.1+cu121 and torchvision==0.20.1+cu121 are stated. Make sure you installed the cuda compatible to your gpu. If your device doesn't support cuda, it's fine to run with cpu-only torch and torchvision version
